        In 1990 after 15 years in the landscape trade, the Davis brothers Ray and Gerald went into business for themselves and started Lobo Landscape Ltd. In the years since itâ€™s inception Lobo Landscape Ltd has garnered a reputation of creating incredibly quality work as unique as each individual client. We have built a loyal client base out of our mutual respect for our community members, with the goal to make London and the surrounding towns as beautiful as possible.

        With a recent change in ownership, Kelly Johnson and Bobby Rogers have taken the reigns after a combined total of nine years mentoring under the Davis brothers. These incredibly ambitious men will forge forward with Lobo Landscape Ltd and continue the impeccable legacy that the Davis brothers have built.
