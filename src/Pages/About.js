        <p>
          In 1990 after 15 years in the landscape trade, the Davis brothers Ray and Gerald went into business for themselves and started Lobo Landscape Ltd. In the years since itâ€™s inception Lobo Landscape Ltd has garnered a reputation of creating incredibly quality work as unique as each individual client. We have built a loyal client base out of our mutual respect for our community members, with the goal to make London and the surrounding towns as beautiful as possible.
